Lab 1: Making an html document.

Objective: The goal of this lab is for you to create a personal web page.

The webpage will consist of at least 3 pages and can be about anything you want.

1. A landing page (index.html) - On this page you will have a &lt header &gt tag, a &lt main &gt tag, and a &lt footer &gt tag. Inside the header tag should be an &lt h1 &gt tag containing the name of your website and a &lt nav &gt tag containing links to other pages on your site. Inside &lt main &gt should be an &lt aside &gt tag and two &lt section &gt tags. The footer tag should just have a copyright date and you name.

The navigation bar will have 3 &lt ul &gt elements containing &lt a &gt tags. The &lt a &gt (anchor) tags turn regular text into hyperlinks that send you to other pages. Please see lesson 4 for examples of anchor tags and lesson 5 for an example of a navigation bar. The first &lt a &gt element will contain the text 'Home', the second &lt a &gt tag will contain the text 'Blog', and the third &lt a &gt tag will contain the text 'Favorite Sites'. Each of these tags should link to a corresponding html file in your project ('Home' should point to index.html, 'Blog' should point to blog.html, 'Favorite Sites' should point to favorite-sites.html). You can use the href attribute to point to the correct file. Again, you can see an example of this in Lesson-4.

Add some text to the &lt aside &gt tag and the two &lt section &gt tags. It can be a simple summary of what your site is all about, or, if you are not in a writing mood, you can download some lorem ipsum from the internet and paste it into these areas.

2. Your blog page should contain the same &lt header &gt tag as the first page (make sure not to mix up the &lt head &gt and &lt header &gt tags, they are two different things. The &lt header &gt tag should occur inside the &lt body &gt tag. Inside your &lt main &gt you should have an &lt h2 &gt tag that says 'Blog'. Following this should be be a section for every blog post you make. Each blog post should start with an &lt h3 &gt tag containing the date and time of the post.

3. On your 'favorite-sites.html page, you should have the same &lt header &gt as the other two pages. Inside you body's &lt main &gt tag should be a list &lt ul &gt of links to your favorite websites. See lesson 5 for an example of how to make lists of things. Remember that links (lesson 4) are contained inside &lt a &gt tags and that the href attribute determines what the hypertext links to. So for example, to link to google.com you would write &lt a href="https://www.google.com" &gt Search &lt /a &gt.
