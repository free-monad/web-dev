Lab 1: Making an html document.

Objective: The goal of this lab is for you to create a personal web page.

The webpage will consist of at least 3 pages and can be about anything you want.

1. A landing page (index.html) - On this page you will have a <header> tag, a <main> tag, and a <footer> tag. Inside the header tag should be an <h1> tag containing the name of your website and a <nav> tag containing links to other pages on your site. Inside <main> should be an <aside> tag and two <section> tags. The footer tag should just have a copyright date and you name.

The navigation bar will have 3 <ul> elements containing <a> tags. The <a> (anchor) tags turn regular text into hyperlinks that send you to other pages. Please see lesson 4 for examples of anchor tags and lesson 5 for an example of a navigation bar. The first <a> element will contain the text 'Home', the second <a> tag will contain the text 'Blog', and the third <a> tag will contain the text 'Favorite Sites'. Each of these tags should link to a corresponding html file in your project ('Home' should point to index.html, 'Blog' should point to blog.html, 'Favorite Sites' should point to favorite-sites.html). You can use the href attribute to point to the correct file. Again, you can see an example of this in Lesson-4.

Add some text to the <aside> tag and the two <section> tags. It can be a simple summary of what your site is all about, or, if you are not in a writing mood, you can download some lorem ipsum from the internet and paste it into these areas.

2. Your blog page should contain the same <header> tag as the first page (make sure not to mix up the <head> and <header> tags, they are two different things. The <header> tag should occur inside the <body> tag. Inside your <main> you should have an <h2> tag that says 'Blog'. Following this should be be a section for every blog post you make. Each blog post should start with an <h3> tag containing the date and time of the post.

3. On your 'favorite-sites.html page, you should have the same <header> as the other two pages. Inside you body's <main> tag should be a list <ul> of links to your favorite websites. See lesson 5 for an example of how to make lists of things. Remember that links (lesson 4) are contained inside <a> tags and that the href attribute determines what the hypertext links to. So for example, to link to google.com you would write <a href="https://www.google.com"> Search </a>.
