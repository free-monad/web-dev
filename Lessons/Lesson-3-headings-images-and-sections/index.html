      <aside>
        Notice that this text is inside of an aside tag. Aside tags are used to indicate text that is not part of the main content or flow of the document. We are just mentioning this tag in passing. The css sheet is responsible for floating it to the left of all of the other text. The tag itself does not determine where aside content goes. The tag itself is semantic, meaning it indicates the meaning of the content inside the tag rather than something about how the content should be rendered.

        <img src="smiley.png">
        <p>
          Notice the smiley image above. This picture is being pulled directly from the same folder as the html file. If you don't see the image, make sure you have it downloaded. See how it is wrapped in an img tag. Also notice the <em>src</em> attribute with the name of the file. This is how the page knows where to look for the image.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also notice all of the h tags at the very top. You can use these for titles and sub-titles of pages following outline forms. They start at h1, the largest and go down to h5, the smallest. They are not necessarily always centered nor a different color. If you remove the stylesheet link in the head of the index file, you will see that the h attribute merely controls the size of the text. All of the rest of the styling is manually defined in the css file style.css which is linked to this page.
