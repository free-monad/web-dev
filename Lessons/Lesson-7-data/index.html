        <p>
	  It is customary to generate data to fill into a page dyamically. Even though when you view a page's code, you may see a long table written hard into the page. It is often the case that either the page was created dynamically by the server (generated on the fly by a computer program) and then delivered to you as a text file or that the data was read from a source url and programmatically inserted into the page. This is especially true if the data is personal and specific to a profile.
        </p>
        <p>
	  There are many ways to achieve this. In this example, the data is being pulled from a url on the internet and injected into an empty table using javascript code. The version here is kind of emulating the process with two js files, but we will see various deployments of this as you progress.
